Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a protocol used for name resolution and computer identification in the local network. LLMNR traffic occurs via UDP **5355** and UDP **137** ports.

When a computer wants to access a resource it does not know, it broadcasts on the local network with the LLMNR protocol, asking who the resource is and maintaining communication with the resource that first responds authoritatively.

By exploiting the working logic of **LLMNR**, an attacker can respond to these broadcasts in a deceptive manner and request the **NetNTLMv2** hash from the client computer for authentication purposes. After the attacker obtains the NetNTLMv2 hash, he can obtain the password using methods such as **Brute Force** and **Dictionary Attack**.

To perform the attack in a lab environment, we will use a tool called Responder. With Responder, we will be able to respond to LLMNR calls and mislead client computers into sending NetNTLMv2 hashes to our own  computer, and we will be able to crack these hashes with the **hashcat** tool and obtain passwords.

`sudo responder -I eth0`

- To trigger LLMNR Broadcast, open the Run application on computer joined in Internal network and try to access a resource that does not exist on the local network.

You can find the NetNTLM hashes captured during testing in the /usr/share/responder/logs/ directory.

After obtaining a valid user with the LLMNR Poisoning method, the attack interface in the Active Directory environment will expand greatly and we will be able to have more comprehensive information.
