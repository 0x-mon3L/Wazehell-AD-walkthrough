Password Spraying is an attack that attempts to access large numbers of accounts using a few commonly used passwords. is the type. In Active Directory tests, after we get the first user, we can get all the user names and test whether they use weak passwords.

When a Domain user is obtained during penetration testing, the attack interface expands significantly. With a valid Domain user, we can learn many things about the Domain.

- Users in the domain
- Password policy  
- User groups  
- Operating system information  
- General information about the domain
- SMB Sharing detection

We will use the **auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login** module in Metasploit for the Password Spraying attack.
