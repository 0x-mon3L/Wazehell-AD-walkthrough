**secretsdump.py** is a tool within the impacket tools that allows us to capture the target's SAM and NTDS.dit database. After capturing the user hashes in the database, we can decrypt these hashes locally and obtain passwords with attacks such as BruteForce and Dictionary Attack, or we can obtain sessions on target computers using the "Pass-The-Hash" method without having to decipher the hashes.
