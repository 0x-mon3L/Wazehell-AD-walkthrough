> We can download the NetNTLMv1/v2 hashes we captured on the local network during the penetration test without the need to decrypt them. By performing a Mitm (Main in the Middle) attack, we can direct it to a second machine, and by gaining a session on the machine we direct, we can run commands, obtain the SAM database and perform post- exploitation operations. In order to direct NetNTLMv1/v2 hashes to a second machine, the SMB Signing feature must be Off on the machine to which we direct the hash. On client machines, this feature is disabled by default.


To find machines where SMB Signing status is Off, we can automatically create a list with CrackMapExec.

`crackmapexec smb 192.168.0.0/24 --gen-relay-list smb-signing-off.txt`

After obtaining the list of target machines in txt format, we will make changes to the configuration settings of the Responder tool, as we will redirect incoming requests to a second tool.

Turn SMB and HTTP servers Off in the configuration file

`sudo nano /etc/responder/Responder.conf`

To verify that the settings are made correctly and the attack works in the lab environment, let's tell the **ntlmrelayx** tool to run a command with the `-c` parameter for testing purposes. You can run `cmd.exe` commands thanks to the `-c` parameter.


#### disable smb signing

```powershell
PS> Get-SmbClientConfiguration | FL requiresecuritysignature

PS> Set-SmbClientConfiguration -RequireSecuritySignature $false
PS> Set-SmbServerConfiguration -RequireSecuritySignature $false

PS> Â Set-SmbClientConfiguration -RequireSecuritySignature 0 -EnableSecuritySignature 0 -Confirm -Force
```
